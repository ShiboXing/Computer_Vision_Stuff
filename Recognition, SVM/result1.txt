After running the compare_representations script with a training set of 12 random images from each class, a typical set
of accuracy results for SVM labeling on pyramids, level0, level1 and level2 SPM representation are
0.5500, 0.2850, 0.4475 and 0.5375 respectively.

The accuracy for pyramids SVM labeling is expectedly the highest among the three, since it relies on BOWs constructed based on
features of three different scales. 

The labeling accuracy for level0 SPM training data is the lowest because its training data calculates the bow based on the sift
of an entire image. We've known instances of drastically different photos can have similar sifts. 

The labeling accuracy for level1 SPM has gotten much better since a 4-quadrant sift is more adequate for differentiating classes.

The labeling accuracy for level2 SPM (1X800) is almost as good as SPM pyramids because it is constitutes the majority of SPM_pyramids. 
It is the most critical part in the pyramids that help classify the classes.
